      'TOEFL test-takers can prepare with AI-powered platform, personalised insights',
      'THE HINDU BUREAU',
      'Those studying for their Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and preparing to take the exam online can use an AI-powered platform called TOEFL TestReady in order to get additional practice and personalised study tips, announced the test’s creator ETS in a post on Wednesday.\nThe TOEFL TestReady platform gives test-takers free and paid offerings including various scored activities, personalised preparation plans, study resources, and test practice with feedback as they work on their reading, listening, speaking, and writing skills in English.\n“With the goal of elevating test takers to their highest proficiency, TOEFL® TestReady™ cements itself as the only comprehensive test prep platform currently available that leverages AI to offer personalized insights and targeted recommendations for a high-stakes English-language test to study or work abroad,” said ETS in its blog post.\nCiting initial research, ETS said that higher scores on the TOEFL TestReady platform made it more likely that the test-taker would achieve a higher score in the actual exam.\n“The platform is uniquely designed to bring all of a test taker’s performance metrics together and offer targeted recommendations and insights that help them close their individual skills gaps, while tracking their progress,” shared ETS.\nThe TOEFL iBT test is taken on a computer and evaluates the test-taker’s English language skills to see if they are qualified for international jobs and study opportunities.\nProof of an acceptable TOEFL or IELTS score is usually one of several requirements for study or work visas in countries such as the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, even if the Indian test-taker was educated exclusively in English.',

      'Candidates studying for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) can now use an AI-powered platform called TOEFL TestReady for additional practice and personalised study tips, according to the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which administers the tests.\n\nThe TOEFL TestReady platform gives test-takers free and paid offerings, including various scored activities, personalised preparation plans, targeted recommendations, study resources and test practice with feedback as they work on their reading, listening, speaking, and writing skills in English, it said.\n\n"The platform is uniquely designed to bring all of a test-taker`s performance metrics together and offer targeted recommendations and insights that help them close their individual skill gaps while tracking their progress," Rohit Sharma, SVP of Global Higher Education and Workskills at ETS, said.\n\n"The unveiling of TOEFL TestReady is important not only because it addresses a need we have heard directly from our test-takers, but because we designed this with them as well. Based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback and data we have collected to date, we are confident that learners will find this platform to be an invaluable part of their testing experience," he said. Initial research has found that the better one`s performance is in TOEFL TestReady, the more likely they are to achieve a higher TOEFL iBT score, Sharma added.\n\nTOEFL, a standardised test to measure the English language ability of non-native speakers who aspire to study in English-speaking universities, is accepted by more than 12,000 institutions in more than 160 countries.\n\nTest-takers who have already created a TOEFL iBT account to register for a test, or who have engaged with the `TOEFL Go!` app can use their login credentials to access the portal. Candidates who are new to TOEFL can create an account at the same link to begin their test prep journey.',

      '8 Top TOEFL Reading Practice Resources to Help You Study',
      'PrepScholar',
      'In order to understand the passages you`ll see in the TOEFL Reading section and accurately answer questions about them, you`ll likely need to do some studying before test day. If you`re not sure how to study for TOEFL Reading, we`re here to help!\n\nIn this guide, we explain the format and types of questions you’ll see on TOEFL Reading then explain the materials you need to do well on this section. We then go over all the best TOEFL Reading practice materials available, including free and official resources. We end with final tips to keep in mind during your studying in order to feel prepared and confident on test day.\n\nOverview of the TOEFL Reading Section\n\nReading is the first section you’ll need to complete for the TOEFL. It’s designed to test your skills in understanding university-level academic texts and passages. You’ll have 60-80 minutes to answer questions based on three to four passages. This variation in time and length is because some test takers will have unscored experimental questions on their TOEFL Reading section, making it extra long, while others will have experimental questions on their Listening section instead. You won’t know which questions are experimental and which are graded, so try not to worry about it too much.\n\nThe passages in TOEFL Reading will each be about 700 words long, and they’ll be followed by about 12-14 questions. The passages will come from university-level textbooks that introduce a topic or discipline. Questions can be multiple choice, inserting a sentence, or putting events in the correct order.\n\nWhat You’ll Need to Be Prepared for TOEFL Reading\n\nWhile this section doesn’t require as many skills as some other parts of the TOEFL, in order to do well on TOEFL Reading, you’ll need to be prepared for each skill you’ll be tested on. TOEFL Reading tests your critical thinking skills, your vocabulary, how well you understand and identify minor details in a text, your ability to make inferences based on the passage, and how well you understand the author’s intent and main points, among other things.\n\nIn order to do well on this section, your TOEFL Reading practice should include the following materials:\n- Complete TOEFL Reading exercises\n- Individual practice questions\n- Opportunities to practice your reading skills\n- Opportunities to expand your vocabulary\n\nIn the next section, we go over the best tools to help you study for TOEFL Reading.\n\nThe Best TOEFL Reading Practice Materials\n\nThis section contains links to the top TOEFL Reading practice materials. What makes a practice material the best? First, the TOEFL Reading exercises must be similar in content and format to the real TOEFL Reading section to give you the best preparation for the real exam. Second, it’s a major bonus if the practice questions come with answer explanations that help you understand why a particular answer is the correct one. Finally, prep materials that include useful tips and strategies for answering Reading questions are useful because they give you advice on how to raise your score on this section.\n\nOfficial TOEFL Reading Practice Tests\n\nOf all the practice materials available for TOEFL Reading, official resources are the best to use since you can be sure they’ll be very similar to the real exam. In this section are all the official TOEFL Reading practice materials available, both free and paid. ETS doesn’t provide just Reading questions, so each of these resources includes practice resources for the other TOEFL sections. Make sure to use at least some of these resources while studying.\n\nTOEFL iBT Sampler\n\nThe TOEFL iBT Sampler is a program you can download with official practice questions, and it’s a great free and official resource to use. In addition to other TOEFL sections, it includes a complete TOEFL iBT Reading practice test (three passages), with a format very similar to that of the real TOEFL. Unfortunately, the Sampler only works with Windows; you can’t download it with a Mac.\n\nTOEFL iBT Quick Prep\n\n Quick Prep contains four PDFs of practice questions, which each contain one or two Reading passages along with question sets. There are a total of six Reading passages, which is the equivalent of two complete TOEFL Reading sections.\n\nTOEFL iBT Sample Questions\n\nThis PDF is another free and official resource. It’s shorter than some of the other resources, but still high-quality. In addition to other question types, it includes one Reading passage with an accompanying question set.\n\nTOEFL Practice Online (TPO) Tests\n\nTPO tests are retired TOEFL exams now sold to people studying for the TOEFL. They give the closest experience to the real TOEFL, and, because of that, they aren’t cheap. You`ll have to pay \$45 for each complete TOEFL you buy (you can’t just buy individual Reading sections). Your exam will be automatically graded after you finish it.\n\nThis is a useful resource, but if you don’t want to spend that much money on a TOEFL iBT Reading practice test, it’s perfectly possible to do well just using the above practice resources.\n\nOfficial TOEFL Prep Books\n\nETS sells several official TOEFL prep books. The Official Guide to the TOEFL Test, in addition to explaining the types of questions on the test, contains numerous practice questions and three full-length exams. There’s also the Official TOEFL iBT Tests Volumes 1 and 2. Each of these books contains five unique TOEFL practice tests, available on paper and the computer.\n\nUnofficial TOEFL Reading Exercises\n\nYou should be careful when using unofficial prep resources since not all of them are reliable. Some are high-quality and very similar to the TOEFL, others are not. Below are some of the top unofficial prep resources for TOEFL Reading. They include both TOEFL Reading exercises and complete TOEFL Reading practice tests. All of them (except the prep books if you buy them) are free.\n\nExam English\n\nThis site has four TOEFL Reading practice tests, each with one passage and about ten questions. It’s not quite as high-quality as official practice resources, but still a good site to use if you’re looking for additional Reading practice.\n\nTest Den\n\nTest Den offers one free, unofficial exam which includes a complete TOEFL Reading practice test with three passages. The passages they use are much closer to the TOEFL than the passages used by many other unofficial sources in terms of length and difficulty level.\n\nTest Prep Practice\n\nTest Prep Practice’s website contains five TOEFL Reading quizzes, each with a passage and about a dozen questions. This resource is not as high-quality as some of the above resources (its questions don’t always follow the format you’ll see on the TOEFL, and some of them aren’t as difficult as many TOEFL questions), but it’s a solid resource if you’re looking for more practice.\n\nGraduates Hotline\n\nThis site has eight Reading passages, each with a set of questions. Like Test Prep Practice, the questions sometimes aren’t a great representative of what the TOEFL will be like, but they will help you get practice with critical reading and vocabulary skills which can be helpful, especially early on in your studying.\n\nUnofficial Prep Books\n\nPrep books, even unofficial ones, are often a great resource for practice questions. Most books include sample Reading questions as well as one or more complete practice TOEFLs at the end of the book. You can learn all about the best TOEFL prep books by reading our guide.\n\nOther Materials to Use for TOEFL Reading Practice\n\nThese resources don`t include specific TOEFL Reading practice tests, but using them can help you strengthen the skills you need in order to do well on this section.\n\nDuolingo\n\nDuolingo is a popular and free site that helps you learn languages. Users answer different types of questions, including reading questions. You can’t choose to only answer reading questions, so this isn’t the best resource for targeted reading practice, but it’s still a good way to strengthen your overall reading, writing, and vocabulary skills.\n\nFor advanced English learners, many of Duolingo’s beginning problem sets will likely be too easy, but you can take a quiz to figure out where in the program you should start.\n\nReading on Your Own\n\nIn order to have strong enough reading skills to understand and analyze the passages you’ll come across in TOEFL Reading, you should make it a habit to read English regularly. It’s best if you do some reading every day in order to build up your skills.\n\nThe most useful things to read will be university-level books and papers, and this is discussed more in the next section. However, any reading in English that you do will help you improve your Reading skills, and many times you learn and improve more when you’re reading something that interests you. Some examples include newspapers, blogs on a topic that interest you, or novels.\n\nVocabulary Resources\n\nA strong vocabulary is essential for doing well on the Reading section where you’ll come across a wide variety of words and occasionally have questions that directly ask you what a specific word means. Reading in English regularly, as mentioned above, will help you learn new words and expand your vocabulary, and you can also check out our guide to the 327 vocab words you need to know for the TOEFL for more ideas!\n\nHow to Get the Most Out of Your TOEFL Reading Prep\n\nNow that you know all the best practice resources for TOEFL Reading you can get started with your studying. The next step is to use those materials in the most effective way in order to get the score you want on test day. Follow these tips in order to get the most out of your TOEFL Reading practice.\n\nRead University-Level Texts\n\n',

      'Students attending a college or university in the U.S. have to submit various documents to be considered for admission, like their high school transcript, essays, teacher recommendations and, in some cases, SAT or ACT test scores. But that list of requirements is longer for international students, who often also need to demonstrate English proficiency.\n\nTo measure language skills, many colleges look at how an applicant fared on a standardized English language assessment. One exam option is the Test of English as a Foreign Language, known as TOEFL, which is administered by the Educational Testing Service, a nonprofit that conducts educational research with an emphasis on testing.\n\nSome U.S. schools prefer TOEFL over other exams, like the International English Language Testing System, known as IELTS.\n\n"So each student will have to look at which schools the`re interested in applying to and determine what that institution will accept," says Dana Brolley, director of international services at the University of Idaho.\n\nFrom qualifying scores to the layout of the exam, here`s what to know about TOEFL and how it compares to IELTS.\n\nWhat Is the TOEFL Exam?\n\nTOEFL has evolved since its inception in 1964. Originally created as a paper-based test, TOEFL transitioned to computer-based in 1998 and then to an internet-based exam in 2005, known as the TOEFL iBT.\n\nThough administered by computer, the TOEFL iBT is taken in person at an ETS-authorized testing center. There are now some exceptions, however. The coronavirus pandemic prompted the launch of an at-home version of the test - the TOEFL iBT Home Edition, which uses a live proctor. The TOEFL iBT and TOEFL iBT Home Edition share the same content: four timed sections in the skill areas of reading, listening, speaking and writing.\n\nThe TOEFL iBT Home Edition isn`t the only new test created by ETS over the last few years. The TOEFL Essentials Test was added in August 2021 and measures the same four skills as the TOEFL iBT. But it`s slightly shorter - 90 minutes - and emphasizes a combination of academic and general English skills, rather than just academic language.',

      'News: English Language Test TOEFL iBT Temporarily Unavailable for Australian Migration Visa Purposes',
      'Insider Guides',
      'TOEFL iBT, one of the previously recognised English language tests for Australian visa applications, will be unavailable for visa purposes starting from 26 July 2023 until further notice.\n\nThis pause is a result of significant revisions being introduced to the test by ETS – the organisation that administers TOEFL iBT – which are currently under review by the Department of Home Affairs.\n\nWhat if I’ve already completed the TOEFL iBT?\n\nIf you have already taken the TOEFL iBT test, there’s no need to panic. The suspension of the test in Australia only affects those who plan to take the test after 26 July 2023. Your TOEFL iBT scores remain valid for Australian visa applications as long as they were acquired before the cut-off date.\n\nIn a statement to Insider Guides, Rohit Sharma, SVP of Global Higher Education and Workskills at ETS confirmed, “The TOEFL iBT test is accepted by 100% of Australian universities and Australian education providers can continue to accept, for admission purposes, valid TOEFL scores from tests taken pre- and post-July 26.”\n\nRevised TOEFL iBT: What’s changing?\n\nThe revised TOEFL iBT, launching globally on 26 July, is set to offer an improved test registration process, simplified instructions for test-takers and a streamlined Reading section, according to ETS. It will also introduce a new Writing section called ‘Writing for an Academic Discussion,’ and remove the mid-test break. All these changes aim to reduce the total test duration from 3 hours to 2 hours and improve the test-taking experience. This enhanced test has been approved by the Canadian government and is currently under review in Australia.\n\n“ETS has submitted the enhanced test to Australia’s Department of Home Affairs (DHA) to be reviewed as part of a standard process the Department takes to evaluate English language tests. We commend the DHA for this thorough review which ensures that its high standards for measures of English proficiency are upheld,” shared Sharma.\n\nAlternate English tests for Australian visas\n\nDespite the current pause on TOEFL iBT, there are other English language test options available to visa applicants:\n\n1. International English Language Testing System (IELTS)\nPearson Test of English (PTE)\n3. Cambridge English (CAE)\n4. Occupational English Test (OET) – specifically designed for healthcare professionals',
